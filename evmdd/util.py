    We use memoization for |EVMDD| nodes and edges to avoid duplicate nodes with
    identical level and children, and duplicate edges with identical weights and
    successor nodes, respectively. Such |EVMDDs| would represent the same
    arithmetic function, and it is both memory efficient to have only one copy
    of each such |EVMDD|, and necessary to guarantee isomorphism reduction of
    all constructed |EVMDDs|. If there is only one `EVMDD` object for each
    arithmetic function, then all |EVMDDs| will be isomorphism reduced by
    construction.
